It has become a ritual for me to sit in with a coffee in a quite place to let my thought flies freely over flash images of the year just passed.

This year is one of the shortest years in my life when the whole world was slowed down by the Covid. There is not many changes in my life except my new job. I still stay in the same place, handle my relationships as bad as usual, stay away from social media noises and maintain a mystery atmosphere around myself. The 8-day trip that I just complete is neither completely relaxed nor intensively hassle. I just planned to have a slight sense about the place that I will stay and the direction that I will go this year.

The world is changing fast in an uncontrollable way. That makes people have to constantly adjust themselves and adapt to the game where the rules is not constant. The way everything goes today could revert all principles which was built yesterday. People around me seems to have a clear direction to go and could manage it well but I know there is forces of gravity under that solid ground that shaping their direction everyday.

People in my field and my friends have a shared dream in general is to create themselves tech startups. Even many of us including me are working in tech startups but we are hired to build others' dreams. I myself and my friends also burn our little spare time on projects which we believe could one day make our world different in some way. That would probably my only choice if I decided some years ago to work abroad and build my career there. But the capricious lady of chance never let our lives go without any surprise. Living in Vietnam in this special covid context takes me to the roundabout of a bunches of directions that I have never faced before. Letting myself staying in that round about just draws more time from me.

This year could surprise the Bien of one year ago by the new job and new environment that I moved to work. There are more challenges and pressure but it gives me new motivation to improve myself. I decided to let this year surprise the Bien today when I look back at some first days of 2023 by adding new gradients to this year plan. It's a common thought that the golden triangle of happiness includes good relationship, financial security and sense of purpose. I let the later two govern me too while not taking care enough for the first corner of the triangle. Committing more time and care for the first corner of the triangle is something I will place at the top of my list this year.

The ordered list would be:

1. Planting our first baby by April.
2. Moving to live in Dalat with Vicky by July.
3. Scheduling weekly time for financial research and investment (keeping at least 500mil in stock by the end of 2022).
4. Saturday morning coffee every week for thoughts even after moving.
