## Notes from the book

### Part I: Two systems
1.  The theory is: Our brain consists of two systems:
    * System 1 (S1): immediate response, intuitive, fast, run all the time.
    * System 2 (S2): detect errors make by System 1 and correct it, run slower; being in the idle mode if no alert from System 1.

2. When we think harder or focus intensively, our pupil size get increase.

3. S2 will not be so active and let the S1 take over (the lazy controller/ depleted ego) when:
    * Our brain went out of glucose (hungry, etc.)
    * We are busy with other thoughts
    * Lazy, the delaying gratification go down

4. The associative machine

    Our brain always try to associate things we see together based on its prior knowledge/experiences. If it detects things is not so associative, it will trigger the system 2. Unless it will just ignore or run at the easy mode.
    * The mavels of priming
        Priming will set the context and influence following information. Body pose could unconciously affect our thoughts.
    * The primes guide us

5. Cognitive ease
